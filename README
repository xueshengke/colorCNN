This project is a simple extension of DeeplearnToolbox, for training a convolutional neural network for other (colorful) image datasets rather than MNIST dataset only.

This modification work is straightforward, i.e. extending the 3-dimensional image data into 4-dimensional data, purely.

For conserving the memory, datasets themselves are not included. Nevertheless, all of them are easy to get from web.
